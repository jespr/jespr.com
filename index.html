          Born and raised in ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° Denmark, currently living in ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ San Francisco, CA. One of my passions is ðŸ“¸ photography -

          Joined <strong>Zendesk</strong> in 2011 as employee #3 in the newly opened Copenhagen office. 80 people globally. Saw the company grow to 1,700 people

        <h3 class="f3 mt5" id="who-am-i">How would I describe myself?</h3>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
          Product focused. I know there are two sides to everything and I always try to take that in to consideration when talking to others.
          I like mentoring and help people get better at what they do. I see my knowledge as useless if I don't share it with people that are interested in learning.
        </p>

        <h3 class="f3 mt5" id="personal-projects">Personal projects</h3>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy measure">
          The following is a list of existing/past personal projects I have been working on.
        </p>

        <ul class="list ml0 pl0 measure-wide">
          <li class="mb4">
            <span class="fr black-40">elixir, postgres, sendgrid, tachyons</span>
            <a href="https://www.formbackend.com" class="green black w-30 db b mb2">Formbackend</a>
            <span class="lh-copy">
              Formbackend makes it so people can add a form to their static HTML page - and Formbackend will capture
              responses being submitted. Good when using Jekyll, Github pages etc.
            </span>
          </li>

          <li class="mb4">
            <span class="fr black-40">elixir, nginx, postgres, tachyons</span>
            <a href="https://www.tabsandspaces.io" class="green black w-30 db b mb2">Tabs &amp; Spaces</a>
            <span class="lh-copy">
              Tabs &amp; Spaces is a blogging platform focused on developers. I mostly write technical content and I found a lot of the existing blogging solutions lacking.
              I wanted to create something where content would be surfaced between different blogs - but things
              like syntax highlighting and grouping posts in to series would be possible.
            </span>
          </li>

          <li class="mb4">
            <span class="fr black-40">rails, postgres, react-native</span>
            <span class="black-50 w-30 db b mb2">Spendiings</span>
            <span class="lh-copy">
              An app to track spending. Didn't like the existing solutions out there like Mint etc. Decided to focus
              on income periods and the amount of money you had within each period (if you get paid bi-weekly,
              and you got paid $1,000 - then you would have $1,000 to spend in the next two weeks). It would automatically
              deduct recurring bills, from the periods based on the frequency. Wrote an integration to pull from your
              bank account automatically using Plaid.

          <li class="mb4">
            <span class="fr black-40">rails, postgres</span>
            <span class="black-50 w-30 db b mb2">MyDailyLife</span>
            <span class="lh-copy">
              Small app that would send you an email at a set daily time to remind you to write your daily journaling entry.
            </span>
          </li>

          <li class="mb4">
            <span class="fr black-40">rails, postgres, react-native</span>
            <span class="black-50 w-30 db b mb2">Photoshare</span>
            <span class="lh-copy">
              A photo sharing application, users create "moments" and all invited users could upload photo to a given moment.
              Had a small mobile application as well, from where users could upload photos and view moments.
